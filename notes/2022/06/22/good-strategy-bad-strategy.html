<h2 id="bad-strategy">Bad strategy</h2>

<p>What most people call strategy nowadays is either simply a statement of their aspirations, goals, and desires or just a mashup of slogans and incomprehensible buzzwords with no actual coherent meaning or actionable elements.</p>

<p>Examples of bad strategies are in abundance and Rumelt has included quite a few in his book – all are worth hearing, along with his advice on how to spot a bad strategy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Good strategy is almost always simple and obvious and does not take a thick deck of PowerPoint slides to explain.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="good-strategy">Good strategy</h2>

<p>Good strategy is essential for overcoming challenging obstacles in the context of limited resources. The core recipe for a strategy (“the kernel”) is simple and yet it’s rare to see it properly implemented in the wild:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – a clear statement of the problem, challenge or obstacle. An assessment of the situation, which focuses attention.</li>
  <li><strong>A guiding policy</strong> – a direction of a solution. It limits the possible actions to take, helps identify <strong>what not to do</strong> and provides a direction that <strong>builds on or creates some form of leverage</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>A set of coherent actions</strong> in the direction of the guiding policy that will implement the solution, building on one another. These may omit some details, but must be detailed enough to be executable and to demonstrate the solution is realistically achievable.</li>
</ol>

<p>All three elements are crucial as they work together. The lack of any of these indicates a flaw in the approach.</p>

<p>The strategy must answer the questions of 1) what, 2) why and 3) how are you trying to do. It focuses efforts and builds on some advantage, using it as a lever to amplify the resources invested and to maximise the results.</p>

<h4 id="good-strategy-will-make-some-people-unhappy">Good strategy will make some people unhappy</h4>

<p>This is a necessary side effect, as strategy means focus and focus means decisions being made to <strong>not do</strong> some things.</p>

<h2 id="the-core-of-a-good-strategy">The core of a good strategy</h2>

<h3 id="1-diagnosis--clearly-state-the-problem-challenge-obstacle">1. Diagnosis – clearly state the problem, challenge, obstacle</h3>

<p>A diagnosis, being a statement of <strong>the problem</strong> to solve, is perhaps the most crucial part of a strategy. It:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prioritises – focuses attention on some issues, deeming those more important than others.</li>
  <li>Links facts into patterns.</li>
  <li>Offers a simplified, easily understandable view of an otherwise complex world.</li>
</ul>

<p>A diagnosis is a judgement call, often an educated guess.</p>

<p><strong>It must be explicitly stated as part of the strategy</strong>, as changes in circumstances might necessitate a change in the diagnosis, thus leading to changes in the overall strategy.</p>

<p>A diagnosis is needed to be able to evaluate and choose among different guiding policies and corresponding sets of actions.</p>

<p>To form a diagnosis, one can start by answering <em>“What’s going on here?”</em></p>

<p>For example, some problems businesses face that might come up in a diagnosis, are usually dealing with change and competition or internal organisational issues: <em>“outdated routines, bureaucracy, pools of entrenched interests, lack of cooperation across units and plain old bad management.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>An especially insightful diagnosis can transform one’s view of the situation, bringing a radically different perspective to bear.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="2-guiding-policy--provide-a-direction-for-the-solution">2. Guiding policy – provide a direction for the solution</h3>

<p>It:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><em><strong>channels action</strong> in a certain direction without defining what exactly needs to be done.</em></li>
    <li><em><strong>creates advantage</strong> by […] reducing the complexity and ambiguity in the situation, <strong>by exploiting the leverage inherent in concentrating effort on a pivotal or decisive aspect</strong> of the situation <strong>and by creating policies and actions that are coherent</strong> – each building on the other, rather than cancelling one another out.</em></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>A guiding policy directs and constrains, without providing details of what exactly to do, thus ruling out a vast array of possible actions. It helps one focus their actions and easily answers the question “Should I do this or that instead?”</p>

<p>The guiding policy should <strong>build on or create some form of leverage</strong>.</p>

<p>Prescribing a direction where <strong>coherent actions</strong> would be possible is crucial, as outlined in the next point.</p>

<h3 id="3-coherent-actions-to-carry-out-the-policy">3. Coherent actions to carry out the policy</h3>

<p>This set of actions to execute is critical to be present in the strategy. They don’t need to be 100% comprehensive and very detailed, but must be executable and should demonstrate that the solution chosen is doable.</p>

<p>This is the “down-to-earth” element of a strategy.</p>

<p>The actions must be:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>coherent</strong> – building upon one another, rather than cancelling each other out), and</li>
  <li><strong>coordinated</strong> – when executed together, they provide a much greater benefit than the simple sum of the result of each action.</li>
</ol>

<p>Coordination requires some degree of centralisation. Decentralisation, while good for some sets of challenges, is not universal and is especially poor when the benefits accrue only if decisions are properly coordinated.</p>

<p>Centralised coordination comes with a cost, however, and one must “impose only the essential amount of coordination”.</p>

<h2 id="amplify-your-efforts-with-various-sources-of-power">Amplify your efforts with various “sources of power”</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A good strategy […] magnifies the effectiveness of actions by finding and using sources of power.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The examples below are somewhat universally applicable but the list is not exhaustive. Rumelt covers these in a lot of detail in the book and accompanies them with many insightful stories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Leverage</strong> – focusing efforts on a pivotal objective, thus multiplying the result of the efforts.</p>

    <p>Strategic leverage arises from anticipation (for what will become important in the future, or how will others react or behave), insight into what’s most critical in a situation and making a concentrated application of effort.</p>

    <p>For example, given limited resources, it’s better to do periodic, focused marketing campaigns and have periods with no marketing spend, rather than spread resources thin and keep some constant level of marketing, as marketing campaigns seem to have a threshold effect – efforts below a certain threshold do not bear any fruits in practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Proximate objectives</strong> – choosing goals that are close enough to be feasible. Unreachable objectives simply suck in resources and serve to confuse and demotivate people.</p>

    <p>A role of a leader is to absorb complexity, remove ambiguity and pass on a problem to the organisation that’s solvable.</p>

    <p>A hierarchy of proximate objectives may be formed to solve a larger problem, breaking those down into finer and finer detail as one cascades down an organisation tree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Chain-link systems</strong> – any system which has its performance limited by its weakest subunit (or, link). This can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Ikea is an example of a well-working chain-link system, each link building on the strength of the previous one – starting from design, then manufacturing, the unique flat packaging and the large stores with their specific mechanics, all working in coherence to provide a unique service. It’s pointless (and even harmful) to duplicate just a part of Ikea’s formula, as the individual pieces can’t work well on their own.</p>

    <p>Fixing a stuck chain-link system is challenging and must be handled centrally, as individual links have no motivation to improve on their own, as that won’t improve the whole and might even be worse for the org as it will suck up resources without meaningful results. One way to approach this is to use proximate objectives – absorb the complexity, focus on issues one at a time and make sure the org will eventually follow through with all improvements on the list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design</strong> is about constructing something novel rather than choosing from a list of existing solutions and about making sure all the pieces fit together coherently. Examples of design-type strategies can be seen in the early Microsoft, early Google, early Walmart, and early Nvidia – all breaking through against companies that were large, long-established, resource-rich but also complacent and inert.</p>

    <p>Design offers a tradeoff that one must be aware of – between tight or loose integration of the components.</p>

    <p>The tighter the integration, the better the resulting performance, and the tighter constraints it can satisfy. But it comes at the cost of more coordination between teams and is also narrower in focus and less flexible. Tighter integration is necessary for greater challenges, or when your resources are limited.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Focus</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>A concentration and coordination of action and resources that creates an advantage.</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Rumelt examines the case of a can-making company, Crown Cork &amp; Seal, which focuses on a specific segment (doing short runs and rush orders for many clients), thus preserving bargaining power and allowing for larger profits compared to other larger can manufacturers, despite its higher cost per unit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Growth</strong> – growth for the sake of it is bad. Acquiring companies makes sense if you’re specially positioned to add more value through this expansion – otherwise, no value is created via the purchase and sometimes you only pay a premium and delude your org. Growth is, however, exciting and that’s why many people fall for it.</p>

    <p>Healthy growth is the outcome of growing demand for special capabilities. The outcome of a firm having superior products and skills. The reward for successful innovation, efficiency and cleverness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Advantage</strong> – No one has an advantage in everything.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>You must press where you have advantages and sidestep situations where you do not. Exploit your rival’s weaknesses and avoid leading with your own.</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In business context, a competitive advantage usually comes out of being able to produce at a lower cost, or at a better-perceived value. Or both. A competitive advantage may also be interesting if you are positioned to increase its value over time somehow.</p>

    <p>A sustained competitive advantage is hard to duplicate, protected by isolating mechanisms – patents, proprietary know-how, economies of scale, network effects, relationships built over time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dynamics</strong> is a way to create or deepen competitive advantages by exploring exogenous waves of change. Examples from the past – electricity, the railway, automobiles, electrical engines, TV, the transistor, the microchip, the universal CPU, internet. The impact of these is obvious in hindsight but is hard to predict while it’s still happening. Train yourself to observe the past and present and try to see a bit better in the upcoming fog of change. Look beneath the surface.</p>

    <p>For example, an obvious consequence of the rise of TV is that many people would want to buy a TV set for their home, but a deeper insight was that cinema had to change as well, as people would no longer go out for the next western.</p>

    <p>Some guideposts to hint about potentially upcoming waves of change – increases in fixed costs, deregulation, predictable biases, incumbent response and attractor states.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inertia and entropy</strong> are among the biggest issues of an organisation. One must be aware of these as a) a way to combat competitors and b) to keep their own organisation in shape.</p>

    <p>Inertia is unwillingness or inability to adapt to a change in circumstances. Rumelt suggests that an organisation may suffer from inertia of routine, cultural inertia and inertia by proxy and gives an example of how to tackle this by restructuring the organisation – break down things into small and more autonomous units, fix them individually, then build back up into a more centralised structure.</p>

    <p>By default, in a closed system (or organisation) entropy is ever-increasing. This means management must exert a constant effort to maintain the org’s purpose, form and methods even if there are no changes in strategy or competition.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thinking-like-a-strategist">Thinking like a strategist</h2>

<p>This section provides advice and a few techniques to improve your analytical process. The most major one is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Think about your own thinking.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pay attention to your internal thought process and improve it.</p>

<p>There is no algorithm for coming up with a good strategy. It’s moving on the edge, pushing the frontier of knowledge and there are no recipes. That’s why improving your analytical abilities helps a lot.</p>

<h3 id="the-science-of-strategy">The science of strategy</h3>

<p>Good strategy is much like a science experiment, as it’s pushing into unknown territory based on some limited facts – one forms a hypothesis, tests it against known facts and principles and then follows with a real-world experiment. Then observes the data and refines. Swift adaptation is key.</p>

<p>The loop goes on:</p>

<p>observations and data → hypothesis → experiment → observations and data → anomaly → new hypothesis → …</p>

<p>This is the process of scientific induction.</p>

<h3 id="think-about-your-thinking--reflect-and-improve">Think about your thinking – reflect and improve</h3>

<p>Make sure to <strong>periodically take a step back</strong>, to reevaluate your goals and purpose and to reflect. Think about the intersection of what’s important and what’s actionable now. Resolve your concerns into action. Make a list of the top 10 most important things you should be doing. This forces you to go through this process.</p>

<p><strong>On gut feeling and quick judgements</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Our instincts can often produce amazingly good judgements, but our instincts also tell us - <strong>incorrectly</strong> - that our instincts are always right; […] <strong>recognise which situations require deeper reflection</strong>. Quick judgements may work well for people situations and certain kinds of pattern matching […]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>…but there are a lot more situations where they don’t.</p>

<p>Some techniques:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have tools to fight your own myopia and guide your own attention.</li>
  <li>Develop the ability to question your own judgement. Generate alternative views and potential solutions and evaluate them as well.</li>
  <li>Create a habit to record (write down) your judgements, so you can improve over time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="form-independent-judgement">Form independent judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bad strategy follows the crowd, substituting popular slogans for insights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Avoid crowd excitement. The original chapter is called “Keeping your head”.</p>
